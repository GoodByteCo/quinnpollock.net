I made a little web-app that tells you how many of the films you've watched were directed by women. Try it for yourself at [here](https://directed-by-women.vercel.app), and use [watchlistpicker.com/?u=thaizy/directed-by-women](https://watchlistpicker.com/?u=thaizy/directed-by-women) to get a random suggestion if you want to watch more women-directed movies. See [womenandhollywood.com](https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/) for more on gender inequality in the film industry.[^1]

[^1]: Note: the site requires that you have a public [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) account. The site uses [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s dataset to determine gender, and may not be accurate. Partly inspired by [James Vaughan's post](https://jamesbvaughan.com/movie-director-genders/) and [accompanying Github project](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/gender-breakdowns) that does the same thing.
