Before I start this, let me preface this with I am Asexual & Aromantic — or Aro-Ace for short. If you don't know what that means, please google it I don't want to explain it here; better yet read the book, Loveless.

I finished reading the book Loveless, and then crying for like ten minutes after, and what can I say but wow. I love this book; this book spoke to me at my core. The experience of Aro-Aceness portrayed in this book mirrors my experience, my coming to turns, and many of the feelings and a lot of the fears I have had remarkably well. It's quite spooky. I swear some of the lines written in this book where stolen right from my brain. I really do wish this existed when I was a kid it really would have helped me alot[^1]. This book discusses so many experiences of aceness in such a humanizing way. The story is so soft and wholesome the characters are quirky and funny, but in a real-life way, no one is a caricature of some stereotype. The way this book discusses friendship is incredible and honestly has even helped me work through some of my own ace-related existential fears. I loved this book. If you're one of my friends reading this, or I guess some random person, and you want to understand me better read this book. If you wish to understand aro-aceness better or just better understand — one example — of the aspec experience read this book, you won't regret it.

I listened to the audiobook partly because I couldn't actually find a hard copy online at the time of writing this. Also, because for fiction, I often enjoy audiobooks more, and it was well done if you're an audiobook person recommended it.

[^1]: That is why they say representation matters.
[^2]: Again at the time of writing this is couldn't find a hard copy so it may not be there. Aswell that link is Canadian based as I am Canadian so if you're not just google the book and hopefully you can find it.
