Before I start this let me prefice this with I am Asexual & Aromantic — or Aro-Ace for short. If you don't know what that means please google it I don't want to explain it here; better yet read the book Loveless.

I just finised reading the book Loveless, and then crying for like ten minutes after, and what can I say but wow. I love this book; this book spoke me at my core. The experiance of Aro-Aceness protrayed in this book mirror my experiance, my coming to turns, and many of the feelings ands alot of the fears I have had remakably well its kinda spooky. I swear some of the lines written in this book where stolen right from my brain. I really do wish this eexisted when I was kid it really would have helped me alot[^1]. This books discusses so many experiances of aceness in such a humanizing way. The story is so soft and wholesome the characters are quirky and funny but in a real life way, no one is caricature of some steortype. The way this book discuss friendship is incredible and honeslty and even help me work through some of my own ace-related existential fears. I loved this book. If your one of my friends reading this, or I guess some random person that wants to understand me better read this book. If you just want to understand aro-aceness better or just better understand — one example — of the aspec experiance read this book you wont regret it.

I actually listened to the audiobook partly because I couldn't actully find a hard copy online at the time of writing this but also becuase for fiction I often enjoy audiobooks more and it was well done if your an audiobook person definitely recommened it.
